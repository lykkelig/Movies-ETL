## Overview of Project
* Create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.
* Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
* Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
* Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
* Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database

## Analysis Three Jupyter notebooks
*  Write a function that reads in the three data files and creates three separate DataFrames.
*  Extract and transform the Wikipedia data so you can merge it with the Kaggle metadata.
*  Extract and transform the Kaggle metadata and MovieLens rating data, then convert the transformed data into separate DataFrames. 

## Summary  End Result
* The movie database was successfully created!
